\section{Team Agreement}
\label{sec:org40a4480}
We will meet \uline{THIS OFTEN} in \uline{THIS PLACE}.
In the event that we are unable to meet, we will reschedule as needed.
If there is a disagreement on implementation, we will attempt to reach a compromise. If one is not possible, the offending parties will each branch the project and attempt to implement their idea, comparing progress and choosing the more effective solution at the time of the next meeting.
\section{Background}
\label{sec:orga233fd7}
The cadet mailroom receives hundreds of packages a week.
Currently, this involves manually scanning, sorting, and distributing notices for each of these packages.
This workflow could easily be reduced using software to track the addresee, mailbox, and filing location of the package
\section{Vision Statement}
\label{sec:org4a012c1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Store information in 2 databases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item to hold cadet info - Name, Box \#, Email Address, Graduation Year. This information can be pulled from regis.
\item to hold package info - type (package or letter) ,tracking number, addressee, received date, picked up date
\end{enumerate}
\item Easy entry. Scan barcode (find a way to pull tracking number from barcode to database), enter addressee.
Program will record \#, name, date - send email to addressee.
Program will indicate where package should be stored in shelving system (mailbox if it is a letter)
\item Search. Enter cadet name or mailbox number, see if there are any packages.
\item Retrieval. Search cadet name, find package and location in filing system. Retrieve package, scan/sign/etc to mark as picked up (Again figure out scanner).

Other functionality?
\end{itemize}
