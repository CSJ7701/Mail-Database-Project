# Mail Database Project

Consists of 1 main file, main.py

# TODO

## Admin Tab
Should have basic admin functionality
- Wipe Database 
- Display root path (where the exe itself is located)
- Other ideas?
- Should be some functionality to upload a database. Later.

# Using
## Prerequisites
Install [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) 
Install [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
Using pip, install:
- tkinter
You will also need:

But these should already be packaged with python.

Run 'git clone https://github.com/CSJ7701/Mail-Database-Project.git'
