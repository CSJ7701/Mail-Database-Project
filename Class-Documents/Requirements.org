* Functional Requirements
- System will accept data entry
- System will record tracking number and addressed box number for incoming packages
- System will add entered information into sql database
- System will associate incoming packages with Cadet information based on addressed box number
- System will notify Cadet upon package arrival
- System will record package status (Picked up or not)
- Users can search database for packages
- System will display all packages matching search terms
- Users can easily update package status
- Developers will write code in an organized fashion, such that the system is easy to expand later.
- System will allow user to categorize packages (e.g. perishable, priority, regular)
- System will authenticate users with a login screen. Certain functionality wil only be available to users with authentication
- System will record a history of package movement and status change
- System will provide reporting tools to the user
- System will feature a status dashboard to show totals and informational breakdowns. 
* Non Functional Requirements
- Will not misassociate packages
- Will allow package entry, given necessary data, within 5 seconds
- Will be easily navigable, with all system functions available within 5 clicks
- Will allow package retrieval, given sufficient search information, within 10 seconds
- Will never fail to retrieve Cadet information, given sufficient correct search information
- Will never allow a package entry without associated Cadet information and association

\hline Scope & Package Notification System \\
\hline Level & User Goal \\
\hline Primary Actor & Cadet \\
\hline Stakeholders and Interests & Cadet: The cadet wants a simple and effective way to get their package \\ & Employee: wants a simple and effective way to find and deliver necessary packages. \\
\hline Preconditions & Cadet receives an email indicating a package is ready \\
\hline Postconditions & Cadet leaves the mailroom with their package. Mailroom staff updates the database, package is marked as delivered. \\
\hline Main Success Scenario & 1. Cadet receives an email notifying them of a package \\
& 2. Cadet arrives at mailroom and requests package \\
& 3. Mailroom conducts "Find Package/ Pickup Package" to retrieve the package. \\
& 4. Cadet takes custoody of their package from mailroom staff. \\
\hline Extensions & 1A. Cadet does not see notification email (did not receive, or simply didn't notice) \\
& 1Ai. In case of a database issue, mailroom staff should be notified.  \\
& 1Aii. Cadets should resolve issues with their own email themselves \\
& 1Aiii. In either case, the mailroom will still have the package; the cadet must then manually check whether a package is there. \\
& 2A. If the cadet does not arrive at the mailroom, the package will be retained indefinitely either until it is retrieved or the addressee graduates. \\
& 3A. If the mailroom fails to locate the package, they must check logs and records that are seperate from this system in order to locate it. \\
\hline Special Requirements & The cadet must receive a package, and be willing to go to the mailroom to pick it up. \\
\hline Technology and Data Variations & Touchpad to sign for package \\
