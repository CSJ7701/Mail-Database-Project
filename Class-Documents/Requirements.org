* Functional Requirements
- Accept data entry
- Record tracking number and addressed box number for incoming packages
- Add entered information into sql database
- Associate incoming packages with Cadet information based on addressed box number
- Notify Cadet upon package arrival
- Record package status (Picked up or not)
- Search database for packages
- Display all packages matching search terms
- Easily update package status
- Developers will write code in an organized fashion, such that the system is easy to expand later.
* Non Functional Requirements
- Will not misassociate packages
- Will allow package entry, given necessary data, within 5 seconds
- Will be easily navigable, with all system functions available within 5 clicks
- Will allow package retrieval, given sufficient search information, within 10 seconds
- Will never fail to retrieve Cadet information, given sufficient correct search information
- Will never allow a package entry without associated Cadet information and association
