* Preface
Tasks to complete assignment:
- Refine application for use
- Analytics Tracking
- Reports and Settings Completion
- Specific classifications/tags for individual packages
- Secure authorization system for users
- Logout feature


Lessons learned and changes from feedback:
- Team should focus more on step-by-step procedures, in order to stay organized.
- Recquire "Admin" or some higher authority credentials to manually add/edit packages within a "database interface"
- Scanning capability
- If package is not picked up within 30 days, archive
- If archived for 6 months, delete from database
