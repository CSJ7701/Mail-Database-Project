\section*{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:orgbbb587b}
\begin{itemize}
\item System will accept data entry
\item System will record tracking number and addressed box number for incoming packages
\item System will add entered information into sql database
\item System will associate incoming packages with Cadet information based on addressed box number
\item System will notify Cadet upon package arrival
\item System will record package status (Picked up or not)
\item Users can search database for packages
\item System will display all packages matching search terms
\item Users can easily update package status
\item Developers will write code in an organized fashion, such that the system is easy to expand later.
\item System will allow user to categorize packages (e.g. perishable, priority, regular)
\item System will authenticate users with a login screen. Certain functionality wil only be available to users with authentication
\item System will record a history of package movement and status change
\item System will provide reporting tools to the user
\item System will feature a status dashboard to show totals and informational breakdowns.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Non Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:orga1c63aa}
\begin{itemize}
\item Will not misassociate packages
\item Will allow package entry, given necessary data, within 5 seconds
\item Will be easily navigable, with all system functions available within 5 clicks
\item Will allow package retrieval, given sufficient search information, within 10 seconds
\item Will never fail to retrieve Cadet information, given sufficient correct search information
\item Will never allow a package entry without associated Cadet information and association
\end{itemize}

\hline\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{UC01 - Retrieve Package (Dan)} \\
\hline Scope & Package Notification System \\
\hline Level & User Goal \\
\hline Primary Actor & Cadet \\
\hline Stakeholders and Interests & Cadet: The cadet wants a simple and effective way to get their package \\ & Employee: wants a simple and effective way to find and deliver necessary packages. \\
\hline Preconditions & Cadet receives an email indicating a package is ready \\
\hline Postconditions & Cadet leaves the mailroom with their package. Mailroom staff updates the database, package is marked as delivered. \\
\hline Main Success Scenario & 1. Cadet receives an email notifying them of a package \\
& 2. Cadet arrives at mailroom and requests package \\
& 3. Mailroom conducts "Find Package/ Pickup Package" to retrieve the package. \\
& 4. Cadet takes custoody of their package from mailroom staff. \\
\hline Extensions & 1A. Cadet does not see notification email (did not receive, or simply didn't notice) \\
& 1Ai. In case of a database issue, mailroom staff should be notified.  \\
& 1Aii. Cadets should resolve issues with their own email themselves \\
& 1Aiii. In either case, the mailroom will still have the package; the cadet must then manually check whether a package is there. \\
& 2A. If the cadet does not arrive at the mailroom, the package will be retained indefinitely either until it is retrieved or the addressee graduates. \\
& 3A. If the mailroom fails to locate the package, they must check logs and records that are seperate from this system in order to locate it. \\
\hline Special Requirements & The cadet must receive a package, and be willing to go to the mailroom to pick it up. \\
\hline Technology and Data Variations & Touchpad to sign for package \\
\hline Frequency of Occurence & Nearly Continuous \\
